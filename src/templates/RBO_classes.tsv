Heavy ion radiation is composed of atomic nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons, resulting in positively charged particles."			"Heavy ion radiation has several notable characteristics and contexts:

High Linear Energy Transfer (LET): Heavy ion radiation has a high linear energy transfer, which means it deposits a significant amount of energy per unit path length as it travels through tissue. This characteristic can lead to more localized and potentially more damaging effects on cells and tissues.

Enhanced Biological Effectiveness: Due to its high LET, heavy ion radiation in many cases has enhanced biological effectiveness, meaning it can cause more severe biological damage per unit of absorbed dose compared to other types of radiation.

Space Radiation: Heavy ions are a component of the galactic cosmic radiation present in space.

In common use, the distinction between heavy ions and light ions is somewhat flexible and context dependent. For example, ""heavy"" is sometimes used to refer to any ion heavier than a helium nucleus or even a proton; in practice the dividing line between light and heavy lies around atomic numbers 6-10."							obo:RBO_00000117

In a controlled experiment, two or more virtually identical experiments are conducted, but the factor being tested is varied in only one of them. This serves to isolate any causal phenomena. A control may have been subject to treatments during the experiment that might alter its state or behaviour and is therefore distinguishable from the sample as initial input into the experiment.
