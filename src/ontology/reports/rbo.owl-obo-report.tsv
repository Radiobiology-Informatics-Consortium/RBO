In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) originating from two gametes join up so that homologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. After the new recombinant chromosome is formed, it is passed on to progeny.

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.  @en"

WARN	annotation_whitespace	device	editor note	"2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \""device\"", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.  "

WARN	annotation_whitespace	BALB/c	rdfs:comment	"Description from https://www.jax.org/strain/000651:

BALB/c mice are particularly well known for the production of plasmacytomas following injection with mineral oil forming the basis for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Although not all BALB/c substrains have been examined for plasmacytoma induction, substrains derived from the Andervont (An) lineage (which includes BALB/cByJ) typically are susceptible, while those descended from BALB/cJ are resistant (see: Potter M, 1985). Mammary tumor incidence is normally low but infection with mammary tumor virus by fostering to MMTV+ C3H mice dramatically increases tumor number and age of onset. BALB/c mice develop other cancers later in life including reticular neoplasms, primary lung tumors, and renal tumors. Rare spontaneous myoepitheliomas arising from myoepithelial cells of various exocrine glands have been observed in both BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ substrains.

White et al. reported a variation in thioglycolate medium-induced peritoneal leukocyte recruitment in 4 analyzed strains. The response of total leukocyte recruitment, from greatest to least, was C57BL/6J>BALB/c>CD1>129X1/SvJ. Variations were also found in the timeline of response and cell types most impacted.

BALB/c mice immunized with PLP180-199 develop an atypical form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in which susceptibility is determined by location. In the spinal cord 60-70% mice develop pathological lesions and in the brain and cerebellum 100% of mice develop sever lesions.

Dorso-ventral vaginal septa is observed in some BALB/cJ females, and may contribute to non-productive females in this strain. (Cunliffe-Beamer T, Lab Anim Sci, 1976)

WARN	annotation_whitespace	CAST/EiJ	textual definition	"

Both CAST/EiJ and CASA/RkJ (Stock No. 000735) were derived from wild mice trapped in Thailand. CAST is often combined with the common laboratory strains to generate F1 hybrids with high levels of heterozygosity for use in genetic mapping. Unlike the wild-derived strain SPRET, male F1 mice from a CAST cross are fertile.

Like CASA, CAST is resistant to flavivirus infection. The flavivirus family includes pathogens responsible for dengue, yellow fever and several forms of encephalitis. Most common laboratory mice are sensitive to flavivirus infection. Resistance/sensitivity is conferred through the oligoA synthase Oas1b locus. In a comparison of multiple strains, CASA and CAST exhibit reduced numbers of retinal ganglion cells as compared to common laboratory strains and other wild-derived strains. In a 2015 study comparing CAST/Ei and the other Collaborative Cross inbred strains (A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, and WSB/EiJ), dorsal root ganglion neurons from CAST/Ei mice demonstrate a significantly improved ability to regenerate axons in an inhibitory environment as determined by an increase in number of neurons with neurites and longer axonal process per neuron under both naive and pre-injured conditions. In addition, as compared to neurons from C57BL/6 mice, CAST/Ei neurons exhibit more extensive axonal regeneration in the spinal cord and optic nerve following injury and show greater sprouting following ischemic stroke.

Wild-derived mice are genetically distinct from common laboratory mice for a number of complex phenotypic characteristics and are valuable tools for genetic mapping, evolution and systematics research.

WARN	annotation_whitespace	FVB/NJ	textual definition	FVB/NJ was inbred for the Fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukemia virus B strain. Due to the prominent pronuclei in their fertilized eggs and the large litter size, FVB/NJ mice are commonly used for transgenic injection. Compared to many other inbred strains, FVB/NJ is highly susceptible to asthma-like airway responsiveness with significant generation of antigen-specific IgE. Despite having the H2q MHC haplotype, FVB/NJ are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis. This resistance stems from coding polymorphisms in Tcra-V11.1 and a genomic deletion of some Tcrb-V genes that includes Tcrb-V8.2. FVB/NJ have higher than average activity, anxiety, and basal body temperature, low stress-induced hyperthermia, and are homozygous for the Pde6brd1 allele, which results in early onset retinal degeneration. Although FVB/N typically do not develop spontaneous tumors, they are highly susceptible to chemically induced squamous cell carcinomas with a high rate of malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma. 
WARN	annotation_whitespace	CBA/J	textual definition	"CBA/J inbred mice are widely used as a general purpose strain.

CBA/J mice are not histocompatible with the CBA/CaJ (Stock No. 000654) substrain (Green and Kaufer, 1965).

The CBA/J inbred mouse strain is used to study granulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (G-EAT), are relatively resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis (Paigen et al. 1990), and develop a mild hearing loss late in life, with most of the hearing loss occurring in the higher frequencies (Sweet et al. 1988). Renal tubulointerstitial lesions have been observed in this strain at a high frequency (Rudofsky 1978). Some CBA/J mice spontaneously develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency syndrome (Eppig and Leiter 1977, Leiter et al. 1977).

INFO	lowercase_definition	CAST/EiJ	textual definition	"

Both CAST/EiJ and CASA/RkJ (Stock No. 000735) were derived from wild mice trapped in Thailand. CAST is often combined with the common laboratory strains to generate F1 hybrids with high levels of heterozygosity for use in genetic mapping. Unlike the wild-derived strain SPRET, male F1 mice from a CAST cross are fertile.

Like CASA, CAST is resistant to flavivirus infection. The flavivirus family includes pathogens responsible for dengue, yellow fever and several forms of encephalitis. Most common laboratory mice are sensitive to flavivirus infection. Resistance/sensitivity is conferred through the oligoA synthase Oas1b locus. In a comparison of multiple strains, CASA and CAST exhibit reduced numbers of retinal ganglion cells as compared to common laboratory strains and other wild-derived strains. In a 2015 study comparing CAST/Ei and the other Collaborative Cross inbred strains (A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, and WSB/EiJ), dorsal root ganglion neurons from CAST/Ei mice demonstrate a significantly improved ability to regenerate axons in an inhibitory environment as determined by an increase in number of neurons with neurites and longer axonal process per neuron under both naive and pre-injured conditions. In addition, as compared to neurons from C57BL/6 mice, CAST/Ei neurons exhibit more extensive axonal regeneration in the spinal cord and optic nerve following injury and show greater sprouting following ischemic stroke.

Wild-derived mice are genetically distinct from common laboratory mice for a number of complex phenotypic characteristics and are valuable tools for genetic mapping, evolution and systematics research.
