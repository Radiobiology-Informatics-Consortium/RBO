<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007729>	"NZO mice of both sexes exhibit high birth weights and are significantly heavier at weaning age. Severe obesity (including both visceral and subcuatneous fat depots) develops even when mice are maintained on a standard diet containing 4.5% fat. Both males and females of the NZO/Hl substrain exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), but subsequent type 2 maturity onset (NIDDM) diabetes development is limited to males, with a phenotype penetrance of 50% or less. NZO/Hl mice also show anti-insulin receptor antibodies, a defect in leptin transport, and hypertension. The genetic lesion appears to be within the islets of Langerhans as transfer of pancreatic islets from normal mice returns body weights and blood glucose levels to within normal range. Ovarian granulosa cell tumors, lymphomas, duodenal, and lung tumors have also been noted to occur in NZO mice at an elevated frequency. F1 hybrids of NON/ShiLt and NZO/Hl provide a new model of obesity-induced diabetes. Male (NON/ShiLt x NZO/Hl)F1 hybrids are obese (BW = 53.5 g by 16 weeks) and almost all develop maturity onset NIDDM. F1 males on a 4% diet will develop hyperglycemia around 20 to 24 weeks of age; increasing the fat content of the diet accelerates diabetes onset to 16 to 20 weeks of age. (NZO/Hl x NON/ShiLt)F1 hybrids will develop diabetes slightly faster than their reciprocal cross due to the NZO maternal environment; however this cross is difficult to produce due to the inherently poor breeding performance of NZO/HlJ female mice. F1 females exhibit a weight gain similar to the NZO parent, and have impaired glucose tolerance but are resistant to diabetes development. Diabetes development can be accelerated to eight to 12 weeks by fostering onto an F1 dam. Reciprocal backcrosses to the parental strains and analysis of (NON/ShiLt x NZO/Hl)F2 mice has led to the identification of a number of complex diabetes-predisposing (\"diabesity\") QTLs. Dr. Leiter's research group at The Jackson Laboratory is currently developing a series of nine recombinant congenic strains (RCS) made by backcrossing the (NZO/Hl x NON/ShiLt)F1 for two generations onto the NON/ShiLt background before inbreeding (~12% NZO/Hl, 88% NON/ShiLt genomes). Preliminary analysis indicates that body weight gains of all RCS are higher than NON/ShiLt, but none are as obese as NZO/Hl; some of these RCS develop NIDDM while others are resistant. These new strains will be useful to further analyze diabesity QTLs and as new models for type 2 (NIDDM) diabetes. An additional benefit of the RCS is better breeding performance than NZO/Hl."

Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water.

The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the highest aortic intercostal artery. This branch is not constant, but is more commonly found on the right side; when absent, its place is supplied by an intercostal branch from the aorta. Each intercostal gives off a posterior branch which goes to the posterior vertebral muscles, and sends a small spinal branch through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the medulla spinalis and its membranes.

The hair interior defect (hid) mutation, a strain characteristic of AKR mice, causes alterations in hair development that is only evident microscopically.

AKR/J mice are relatively resistant to aortic lesion formation on a semi-synthetic high fat diet and are hyporesponsive to diets containing high levels of fat and cholesterol."

The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily.

Due to the prominent pronuclei in their fertilized eggs and the large litter size, FVB/NJ mice are commonly used for transgenic injection. Compared to many other inbred strains, FVB/NJ is highly susceptible to asthma-like airway responsiveness with significant generation of antigen-specific IgE. Despite having the H2q MHC haplotype, FVB/NJ are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis. This resistance stems from coding polymorphisms in Tcra-V11.1 and a genomic deletion of some Tcrb-V genes that includes Tcrb-V8.2. FVB/NJ have higher than average activity, anxiety, and basal body temperature, low stress-induced hyperthermia, and are homozygous for the Pde6brd1 allele, which results in early onset retinal degeneration. Although FVB/N typically do not develop spontaneous tumors, they are highly susceptible to chemically induced squamous cell carcinomas with a high rate of malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma.

The lumen of the blood vessels thus formed is probably intracellular. The flattened cells at the periphery form the endothelium. The nucleated red blood corpuscles develop either from small masses of the original angioblast left attached to the inner wall of the lumen or directly from the flat endothelial cells. In either case the syncytial mass thus formed projects from and is attached to the wall of the vessel. Such a mass is known as a blood island and hemoglobin gradually accumulates within it. Later the cells on the surface round up, giving the mass a mulberry-like appearance. Then the red blood cells break loose and are carried away in the plasma. Such free blood cells continue to divide.

<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007727>	"\n\nBoth CAST/EiJ and CASA/RkJ (Stock No. 000735) were derived from wild mice trapped in Thailand. CAST is often combined with the common laboratory strains to generate F1 hybrids with high levels of heterozygosity for use in genetic mapping. Unlike the wild-derived strain SPRET, male F1 mice from a CAST cross are fertile.\n\nLike CASA, CAST is resistant to flavivirus infection. The flavivirus family includes pathogens responsible for dengue, yellow fever and several forms of encephalitis. Most common laboratory mice are sensitive to flavivirus infection. Resistance/sensitivity is conferred through the oligoA synthase Oas1b locus. In a comparison of multiple strains, CASA and CAST exhibit reduced numbers of retinal ganglion cells as compared to common laboratory strains and other wild-derived strains. In a 2015 study comparing CAST/Ei and the other Collaborative Cross inbred strains (A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, and WSB/EiJ), dorsal root ganglion neurons from CAST/Ei mice demonstrate a significantly improved ability to regenerate axons in an inhibitory environment as determined by an increase in number of neurons with neurites and longer axonal process per neuron under both naive and pre-injured conditions. In addition, as compared to neurons from C57BL/6 mice, CAST/Ei neurons exhibit more extensive axonal regeneration in the spinal cord and optic nerve following injury and show greater sprouting following ischemic stroke.\n\nWild-derived mice are genetically distinct from common laboratory mice for a number of complex phenotypic characteristics and are valuable tools for genetic mapping, evolution and systematics research.\n"

As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+ ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmolarity and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth."	"FMA:67559"

This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."@en

Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for exemple of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell."	"Wikipedia:Exocytosis"
